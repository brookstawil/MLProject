    "#### Problem \n",
    "The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests. Based on the input data from 11 features of chemical properties, an output quality score from 0 to 10 is assigned to each instance. We would formulate this in terms of a regression problem where we attempt to arrive at a quality rating based on input chemical data.\n",

    "If we could somehow get measures of wines from outside of this dataset would could come up with an interesting and useful regression based algorithm."
