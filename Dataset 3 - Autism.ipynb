    "### Dataset 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides 20 attributes to help determine if an adult could be on the autistic spectrum or have ASD. The data provided is based upon autism screening of adults in contrast to most other datasets based on behavior traits. In the dataset, 10 behavioral and 10 individual characteristics are provided.\n",

    "#### Problem\n",
    "Our goal is to create a classifier, that can diagnose autism based on the answers to certain questions and physical characteristics. This is a classification problem and very much mirrors our hypothetical situations of diagnosing cancer that we discuss in class. Except our features are more based around psychological evaluation and not physical traits and attributes of a physical ailment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extending the problem\n",
    "Out of all of the datasets, this one has the most social impact, and the creation of such an algorithm is most likely already the subject of study in various academic realms."
